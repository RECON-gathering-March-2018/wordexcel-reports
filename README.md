# wordexcel-reports

Our 3 hour hackathon 5 person team ([Lore](https://github.com/loremerdrignac), [Sumali](https://github.com/sumalibajaj), [Stephan](https://github.com/gstephan30), [Lukas](https://github.com/lukric), [Michael](https://github.com/hoehleatsu)) sprint output can be found here: [https://github.com/RECON-gathering-March-2018/wordexcel-reports](https://github.com/RECON-gathering-March-2018/wordexcel-reports). See the [*Issues*](https://github.com/RECON-gathering-March-2018/wordexcel-reports/issues) page to see some bullet points what we worked with. Download for example the export of a ggplot epicurve into a modifiable [Excel/Powerpoint](https://github.com/RECON-gathering-March-2018/wordexcel-reports/blob/master/Output/expamle.pptx) graphic in the Output directory - this is really neat!
